\section{Grammar}

\subsection{Types}
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\tau & \define & \mid \tau_0 \to \tau_1 \mid \{\rho\} \mid \variant{\rho}
\\
\rho & \define & \cdot \mid \_ : \tau \mid l : \tau, \rho
\\
l & \define & \text{row field labels}
\\
\alpha & \define & \text{bound type variables}
\end{array}
\]

$FV(\tau)$ denotes the free type variables of $\tau$ defined in the
usual way where the only type variable binder is $\forall\alpha.\tau$.

A row is {\it closed} if it ends in $\cdot$. We abuse $,$ to stand
for both adding a label to a row (e.g. $l:\tau,\rho$) and {\it appending}
two rows together when the first row is closed; e.g.
\[
(l_0:\tau_0,\l_1:\tau_1,\cdot),(l_2:\tau_2,l_3:\tau_3,\_:\tau)
\quad
\equiv
\quad
l_0:\tau_0,\l_1:\tau_1,l_2:\tau_2,l_3:\tau_3,\_:\tau
\]
Furthermore, writing $\rho_0,\rho_1$ implies $\rho_0$ is closed,
so $\rho,\_:\tau$ implies $\rho$ is closed and $\rho,\cdot
\equiv \rho$.

We do not forbid multiple occurrences of the same label in a row;
outer (to the left) occurrences shadow inner occurences as specified
in~\ref{subsec:type-lookup}.

\subsection{Type Substitution}
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \alpha[\alpha := \tau] & = & \tau \\
  \alpha'[\alpha := \tau] & = & \alpha' \quad(\alpha \neq \alpha') \\
  (\tau_0 \to \tau_1)[\alpha := \tau] & = & \tau_0[\alpha:=\tau]\to\tau_1[\alpha:=\tau]\\
  \{\rho\}[\alpha := \tau] & = & \{\rho[\alpha:=\tau]\}\\
  \variant{\rho}[\alpha := \tau] & = & \variant{\rho[\alpha:=\tau]} \\
  \\
  (\cdot)[\alpha := \tau] & = & \cdot \\
  (\_ : \tau')[\alpha := \tau] & = & \_ : \tau'[\alpha := \tau] \\
  (l:\tau', \rho)[\alpha := \tau] & = & l:\tau'[\alpha:=\tau],\rho[\alpha:=\tau]
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Terms}

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
e & \define & x \mid \lam{x}{e} \mid \app{e_0}{e_1} \mid \{r\} \mid e\#l \mid \variant{l:e} \mid \case{e_0}{e_1}
\\
r & \define & \cdot \mid \_ : e \mid l : e, r
\\
x & \define & \text{bound term variables}
\end{array}
\]

$FV(e)$ denotes the free term variables of $e$ defined in the usual way where the only variable binder is $\lam{x}{e}$.

\subsection{Term Substitution}
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
  x[x:=e] & = & e \\
  x' [x:=e] & = & x' \quad (x\neq x') \\
  (\lam{x}{e'})[x:=e] & = & \lam{x}{e'} \\
  (\lam{x'}{e'})[x:=e] & = & \lam{x''}e'[x':=x''][x:=e] \quad (x\neq x' \,\wedge\, x\neq x'' \,\wedge\, x''\not\in FV(e)) \\
  (\app{e_0}{e_1})[x:=e] & = & \app{e_0[x:=e]}{e_1[x:=e]} \\
  \{r\}[x:=e] & = & \{r[x:=e]\} \\
  (e'\#l)[x:=e] & = & (e'[x:=e])\#l \\
  \variant{l:e'}[x:=e] & = & \variant{l:e'[x:=e]} \\
  (\case{e_0}{e_1})[x:=e] & = & \case{e_0[x:=e]}{e_1[x:=e]} \\
  \\
  (\cdot)[x:=e] & = & \cdot \\
  (\_ : e')[x:=e] & = & \_ : e'[x:=e] \\
  (l : e', r)[x:=e] & = & l:e'[x:=e], r[x:=e]
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Contexts}
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\G & \define & \cdot \mid x : \tau, \G
\end{array}
\]
We assume that well formed contexts have a single occurrence of any variable.

\section{Typing}

\subsection{Type Label Lookup \;($\haslbl{\rho}{l}{\tau}$)}
\label{subsec:type-lookup}
\[
\deduct

\qquad
\deduct
    {\haslbl{\rho}{l}{\tau}}
    {\haslbl{l':\tau',\rho}{l}{\tau}}
    {(l \neq l')}
\]

Note that we allow instantiation of polymorphic fields during type
label lookup to facilitate the formulation of the constraint, in~\ref{subsec:case-constraint}, on
the rows involved in a $\case{e_0}{e_1}$ expression.

\subsection{Case Constraint \;($\caseVarRcd{\rho_0}{\rho_1}{\tau}$)}
\label{subsec:case-constraint}
\[
\deduct
    {\haslbl{\rho_1}{l_0}{\tau_0\to\tau} \quad \caseVarRcd{\rho_0}{\rho_1}{\tau}}
    {\caseVarRcd{l_0:\tau_0,\rho_0}{\rho_1}{\tau}}
    {}
\qquad
\deduct
    {}
    {\caseVarRcd{\cdot}{\rho}{\tau}}
    {}
\qquad
\deduct

%    {\caseVarRcd{\_:\tau_0}{l:\tau_l,\rho}{\tau}}

\]
The third rule above is meant to capture the idea that a variant type
with a default label can only be ``eliminated'' by a record type with a
default label.

\section{A Tighter Coupling of Records and Variants}
Record terms are currently used to consume variant terms, i.e. in
$\case{e_0}{e_1}$, the second argument $e_1$ should be a record;
however there is a bit of lost symmetry since variant terms are not
involved in consuming records. In this section we slightly reformulate
the system to allow this symmetry. Specifically we will use projection
as the single elimination form for both records and variants, and we
will modify projection to take a variant as a second argument, rather
than a label; this change also removes the reliance on raw labels,
which are not first class values, in the core expressions.
\\

\subsection{Project Fun \;($\projFunRule{\rho_0}{\rho_1}{\tau}$)}
\label{subsec:case-constraint}
\[
\deduct
    {\haslbl{\rho_0}{l_1}{\tau_1\to\tau} \quad \projFunRule{\rho_0}{\rho_1}{\tau}}
    {\projFunRule{\rho_0}{l_1:\tau_1,\rho_1}{\tau}}
    {}
\qquad
\deduct
    {}
    {\projFunRule{\rho}{\cdot}{\tau}}
    {}
\qquad
\deduct
    {\haslbl{\rho}{l}{\tau_0\to\tau}}
    {\projFunRule{\rho}{\_:\tau_0}{\tau}}
    {(l\not\in\rho)}
\]
Third rule above is interpretation of term variant default label as
only being able to project the term record default label; removing the
condition would change this to allowing the (non-deterministic)
projection of any suitable label.

\section{Default Labels}

There are multiple interpretations we can think for default labels, specifically
with regards to projection and \texttt{case} of the default label itself.
Everything else works similarly between interpretations. Since projection can be
thought of as a special \texttt{case}, we'll only deal with the latter.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The way that is described in this system presently treats the default
  label as a regular label in a record. A variant with a default label matches
  the default label in a record it is \texttt{case}d with.

  However, the presence of a default label makes all lookups suceed. If a
  variant fails to match any labels direclty in a record for a \texttt{case}, it
  matches with the default label.

  So this assigns a special meaning to an otherwise normal label.

\item Another way we can think of the default label as is a selector for
  everything that is not in the variant. However, if the default label in a
  variatn matches with multiple functions in its corresponding record, what do
  we do with all of their return values? A function typically cannot return a
  variable number of values.

  One solution that lets us match everything missing is to impose a constraint
  upon \texttt{case} statements. Specifically, \texttt{case} statements would
  take a third argument: a combining function \(f\). If the return type of each
  function in the record argument is \(\tau\), then \(f : \tau \to \tau \to
  \tau\). By necessity, \(f\) would need to be commutative.

  This would let us, for example, collect all of the results that don't match
  into a list like so
  \[\case {\variant{\_ : ()}} {\{a : \lambda x. [1], b : \lambda x. [2]\}} = [1,2]\]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Small-Step Semantics}

These semantics are agnostic about whether we are using default labels. If not, we could simplify
the system by writing the typing and evaluation rules without using special lookup judgments
(e.g., ``$\haslbltm{r}{l}{e_r}$'' could be replaced by ``$r = r_1, l{:}e_r, r_2$ where $l\not\in r_1$''.)

% We use $v$ to refer to a value and $r_v$ to refer to the contents of a record value, e.g.,

% \[\begin{array}{rcl}
% v & \define & \lam{x}{e} \mid \{r_v\} \variant{l:v}
% \\
% r_v & \define & \cdot \mid \_ : v \mid l : v, r
% \\
% \end{array}
% \]

We could enforce left-to-right evaluation by having the second ``case'' rule
start working on $e_1$ only if $e_0$
is already a value, but in the absence of side-effects it doesn't matter.

We use $v$ to refer to a value. We assume call-by-name, so that record values and
variant values can contain "unevaluated" expressions.

\[\begin{array}{rcl}
v & \define & \lam{x}{e} \mid \{r\} \mid \variant{l:e}\\
\end{array}
\]


\begin{lemma}{Canonical Forms} \label{lem:canonical-forms}
\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\hastp{\cdot}{v}{\tau_1\to\tau_2}$ then $v$ is $\lam{x}{e}$.
\item If $\hastp{\cdot}{v}{\{\rho\}}$ then $v$ is $\{r\}$.
\item If $\hastp{\cdot}{v}{\variant{\rho}}$ then $v$ is $\variant{l:e}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Without polymorphism, it follows directly by inspection of the typing rules. (E.g.,
the only typing rule that lets us conclude a value has an arrow type is the rule for
typing lambdas, so any value with an arrow type must be a lambda.)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Progress]
if $\hastp{\cdot}{e}{\tau}$ then either $e$ is a value or else $\step{e}{e'}$ for some $e'$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By (structural) induction on the proof that $\hastp{\cdot}{e}{\tau}$.

If \(e\) is a value, then the proof is complete.

If \(e\) is not a value, we examine the proof tree for \(\hastp \cdot e \tau\).

We consider the possible cases for \(e\), ignoring ones that are values.

\begin{itemize}
\item Case
    \[
      \deduct
      {\hastp{\G}{e_0}{\tau_1\to\tau}
      \quad
      \hastp{\G}{e_1}{\tau_1}
      }
      {\hastp{\G}{\app{e_0}{e_1}}{\tau}}
      {}
    \]

    We know that \(\hastp \cdot {e_0} {\tau_1 \to \tau}\) and \(\hastp \cdot
    {e_1} \tau_1\).

    There are two cases to consider for \(e_0\).

    If \(e_0\) is a value, then by lemma \ref{lem:canonical-forms} we conclude
    that \(e_0 = \lambda x. e_0'\) for some \(e_0'\). We may then apply the
    \(\step {(\lambda x.e_0') e_1} {e_0'[x:=e_1]}\) rule. So for this case, we
    conclude \(\step e {e'}\) for an \(e' = e_0'[x:=e_1]\).

    If \(e_0\) is not a value, then by the induction hypothesis we know that
    there exists some \(e_0'\) such that \(\step e_0 {e_0'}\). We may then apply
    the \(\step {e_0 e_1}{e_0' e_1}\) rule. For this case, we conclude \(\step e
    {e'}\) for an \(e' = e_0' e_1\).

  \item Case
    \[
      \deduct
      {\hastp{\G}{e}{\{\rho\}}
      \qquad
      \haslbl{\rho}{l}{\tau}
      }
      {\hastp{\G}{e\#l}{\tau}}
      {}
    \]

    We know that \(\hastp \cdot {e_0} {\{\rho\}}\) and
    that \(\haslbl \rho \ell \tau\).

    If \(e_0\) is a value, then by lemma \ref{lem:canonical-forms}, \(e_0\) is
    some record \(\{r\}\). By lemma \ref{lem:row-type-term}, \(\haslbltm r \ell
    {e_0'}\). We may then apply the \(\step {\{r\} \# \ell} {e_0'}\) rule. For this
    case, we conclude \(\step e {e_0'}\).

    If \(e_0\) is not a value, then by the induction hypothesis we know that
    there exists some \(e_0'\) such that \(\step e_0 {e_0'}\). We may then apply
    the \(\step {e_0 \# \ell}{e_0' \# \ell}\) rule. For this case, we conclude
    \(\step e {e'}\) for an \(e' = e_0' \# \ell\).

  \item Case
    \[
      \deduct
      {\hastp{\G}{e_0}{\variant{\rho_0}}
      \quad
      \hastp{\G}{e_1}{\{\rho_1\}}
      \quad
      \caseVarRcd{\rho_0}{\rho_1}{\tau}
      }
      {\hastp{\G}{\case{e_0}{e_1}}{\tau}}
      {}
    \]

    We know \(\hastp \cdot {e_0} {\variant {\rho_0}}\), \(\hastp \cdot {e_1}
    {\{\rho_1\}}\), and \(\caseVarRcd {\rho_0} {\rho_1} \tau\).

    If either \(e_0\) or \(e_1\) is not a value, we may proceed as in the
    non-value cases of the application or projection parts of the proof by using
    the induction hypothesis and the corresponding step rule.

    If both \(e_0\) and \(e_1\) are values, we conclude from lemma
    \ref{lem:canonical-forms} that \(e_0 = \variant{\ell : e_0'}\) and \(e_1 =
    \{r\}\). Examining the rules for case constraint, it must be the case that
    \(\haslbl {\rho_1} \ell {\tau_0 \to \tau}\) because \(\rho_0\) is nonempty
    (this is trivially true because \(e_0\) is a value with type \(\variant
    {\rho_0}\)). The only way for \(\rho_1\) to not have label \(\ell\) would be
    for \(\rho_0\) to not have label \(\ell\). By lemma \ref{lem:row-type-term},
    it must be the case that \(\haslbltm{r}{\ell}{e_1'}\). Therefore, we may
    apply rule \(\step {\case {\variant {\ell : e_0'}} {\{r\}}} {e_1' e_0'}\)
    and this case is complete.

\end{itemize}

These cases cover all of the non-values. Since the values constitute the base
cases of the structural induction, and the inductive hypothesis holds, the proof
is complete.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{Inversion} \label{lem:inversion}

  The following hold:

  \mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\hastp{\Gamma}{\app{e_0}{e_1}}{\tau}$ then
  $\hastp{\Gamma}{e_0}{\tau_1\to\tau}$ and $\hastp{\Gamma}{e_1}{\tau_1}$ for some type $\tau_1$.
\item If $\hastp{\Gamma}{\lam{x}{e}}{\tau}$ then $\tau = (\tau_1\to\tau_2)$ for
some types $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$, and
  $\hastp{\Gamma,x:\tau_1}{e}{\tau_2}$.
\item If \(\hastp \Gamma {e \# \ell} \tau\), then \(\hastp \Gamma e {\{\rho\}}\)
  and \(\haslbl \rho \ell \tau\).
\item If \(\hastp \Gamma {\case e_0 e_1} \tau\), then \(\hastp \Gamma {e_0}
  {\variant {\rho_0}}\), \(\hastp \Gamma {e_1} {\{\rho_1\}}\), and \(\caseVarRcd
  {\rho_0} {\rho_1} \tau\).
\item If \(\hastp \Gamma {\variant {\ell : e}} {\variant \rho}\), then \(\haslbl
  \rho \ell t\) and \(\hastp \Gamma e \tau\).
\item If \(\hastp \Gamma {\lambda x. e} {\tau_0 \to \tau}\), then \(\hastp
  {\Gamma, x : \tau_0} e \tau\).
\item Other facts as needed\ldots
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By inspection of the inference rules. (I.e., if we have a complete typing proof,
and there is only one possible typing rule that can give us the corresponding conclusion,
then the proofs of the premises of that rule must be contained within our assumed typing proof.)

One caveat: the variant case can either come from a deault variant derivation or
a regular variant derivation. The latter follows immediately from the rules. The
former follows from the fact that if a label is in the variant term but not in
its type, its expression must have the default type.

% This becomes difficult if it turns out that \(e_0 : \tau_1 \to (\forall \alpha.
% \tau')\). In which case, we can prove a lemma that state that \(e_0 : \forall
% \alpha. (\tau_1 \to \tau')\) is equivalent and show that the derivation remains
% the same. Basically, all of these cases still need to deal with the possibility
% that the type comes from a forall elimination, which may need some finessing.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{Row Type-Term Correspondance} \label{lem:row-type-term}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \(\hastp \Gamma {\{r\}} {\{\rho\}}\), then \(\haslbl \rho \ell \tau\)
    if and only if \(\haslbltm r \ell e\) and \(\hastp \Gamma e \tau\).
  \item If \(\hastp \Gamma {\variant {\ell : e}} {\variant \rho}\), then
    \(\haslbl \rho \ell \tau\) and \(\hastp \Gamma e \tau\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The proofs follow from the respective rules.
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \((\Rightarrow)\) Suppose that \(\haslbl \rho \ell \tau\). There are two
    cases.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\ell\) is in \(\rho\). Then for \(\{r\}\) to have type \(\{\rho\}\), it
      must contain \(\ell\) and furthermore \(e\) must have type \(\tau\). This
      follows from the fact that only one rule could result in \(\{r\}\) having
      type \(\{\rho\}\).
    \item \(\ell\) is not in \(\rho\). Then for \(\{r\}\) to have type
      \(\{\rho\}\), it must contain a default and furthermore the \(e\)
      corresponding to this default must have type \(\tau\). This again follows
      from the fact that there is one rule that could result in \(\{r\}\) having
      type \(\{\rho\}\).
    \end{itemize}

    \((\Leftarrow)\) This follows in a similar manner as the forward direction,
    except with the logic reversed (observe that the term and type level lookups
    are almost identical; they just deal with different objects).
  \item This follows from lemma \ref{lem:inversion}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Preservation]
If $\hastp{\cdot}{e}{\tau}$ and $\step{e}{e'}$ then $\hastp{\cdot}{e'}{\tau}$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
  By (structural) induction on the term $e$ and typing derivation \(\hastp \cdot
  e \tau\). We consider all of the possible forms that \(e\) can take.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Case \(\step {e_0 e_1} {e_0' e_1}\). Since \(\hastp \cdot {e_0 e_1}
    \tau\), lemma \ref{lem:inversion} means that \(\hastp \cdot {e_0} {\tau_0
      \to \tau}\) and \(\hastp \cdot {e_1} {\tau_0}\).

    By the induction hypothesis, \(\hastp \cdot {e_0'} {\tau_0 \to \tau}\). This
    allows us to use the application typing rule to derive that \(\hastp \cdot
    {e_0' e_1} \tau\), as desired.
  \item Case \(\step {(\lambda x. e')e_1} {e'[x:=e_1]}\). Like the above, since
    \(\hastp \cdot {(\lambda x.e') e_1} \tau\), lemma \ref{lem:inversion} means
    that \(\hastp \cdot {(\lambda x.e')} {\tau_0 \to \tau}\) and \(\hastp \cdot
    {e_1} {\tau_0}\). We may apply lemma \ref{lem:inversion} again to conclude
    that \(\hastp {x : \tau_0} {e'} \tau\). Lemma \ref{lem:substitution} gives
    that \(\hastp \cdot {e'[x:=e_1]} \tau\), as desired.
  \item All other cases involving steps in subparts of the equation have proofs
    following the same direction (appeal to lemma \ref{lem:inversion} followed
    by application of the induction hypothesis, then an amendment to the
    derivation of \(\hastp \cdot e \tau\) that results in \(\hastp \cdot {e'}
    \tau\)).
  \item Case \(\step {\{r\} \# \ell} {e_\ell}\). By lemma \ref{lem:inversion},
    we conclude that \(\hastp \cdot e {\{\rho\}}\) and \(\haslbl \rho \ell
    \tau\). From this, we may use lemma \ref{lem:row-type-term} to conclude that
    \(\hastp \cdot {e_\ell} \tau\), as desired.
  \item Case \(\step {\case {\variant {\ell : e_\ell}} {\{r\}}} {e_r e_\ell}\).
    By lemma \ref{lem:inversion}, we conclude that \(\hastp \cdot {\variant
      {\ell : e_\ell}} {\variant {\rho_0}}\), \(\hastp \cdot {\{r\}}
    {\{\rho_1\}}\), and \(\caseVarRcd {\rho_0} {\rho_1} \tau\). By lemma
    \ref{lem:row-type-term}, we know that \(\hastp \cdot {e_\ell} {\tau_\ell}\)
    and \(\haslbl {\rho_0} \ell {\tau_\ell}\). Because \(\caseVarRcd {\rho_0}
    {\rho_1} \tau\), it must be that \(\haslbl {\rho_1} \ell {\tau_\ell \to
      \tau}\). By lemma \ref{lem:row-type-term}, we know that \(\haslbltm r \ell
    {e_r}\) and \(\hastp \cdot {e_r} {\tau_\ell \to \tau}\). The types of
    \(e_\ell\) and \(e_r\) allow us to derive \(\hastp \cdot {e_\ell e_r}
    \tau\), as desired.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Substitution] \label{lem:substitution} If \(\hastp {\Gamma_0, x :
    \tau_x, \Gamma_1} e \tau\) and \(\hastp {\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1} {e'}
  {\tau_x}\), then \(\hastp {\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1} {e[x:=e']} \tau\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  % Follows by induction on the structure of \(e\). I think. \todo{write proof}

  % For the base case (variable case), can use inversion to conclude that if the
  % variable is not equal to the one subsituted, it must be in either \(\Gamma_0\)
  % or \(\Gamma_1\) and use that to conclude it works (avoids a weakening lemma).

  We will modify the typing derivation \(\hastp {\Gamma_0, x : \tau_x, \Gamma_1}
  e \tau\) so that it becomes \(\hastp {\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1} {e[x:=e']} \tau\).
  This modification can happen recursively, and in most cases all it requires is
  recursive traversals or empty base cases. The only missing case is that for
  variables.

  \[
    \deduct
      {x : {\tau_x} \in \Gamma}
      {\hastp \Gamma x {\tau_x}}
  \]

  Since the substitution will always replace \(x\) with \(e'\), we may modify
  this case to simply be the proof \(\hastp \Gamma {e'} {\tau_x}\), which is a
  premise. Since this is the only place where \(x : \tau_x\) is used in the
  context, it's safe to be removed from the updated context.

  \[
    \deduct
      {y : \tau \in \Gamma}
      {\hastp \Gamma y \tau}
      {(y \ne x)}
  \]

  In this case, nothing needs to happen since no substitution will happen in
  \(y\). And since \(y : \tau\) is not \(x : \tau_x\), it will not be removed
  from the context of the resulting derivation.
\end{proof}
